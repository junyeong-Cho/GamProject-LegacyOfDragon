### Game Overview and How to Play

**Legacy of Dragon** is a top-down shooting game where you clear stages by using skills to defeat enemies. Each stage presents a specific number and type of enemies attempting to take you down. If you take too much damage, the dragon falls, and the game ends.

**Gameplay:**
- **Pre-game:** Control the dragon using WASD keys.
- **In-game:** When you acquire certain items, your attacks become stronger, and you gain special skills. Use these abilities to fend off increasingly powerful waves of enemies.

**Controls:**
- **WASD:** Moving the dragon
- **Mouse Left:** Shoot the fire
